#Loop detection parameters
#Use standalone environment /cmr_lidarloop/detector to train and test loop detectors
loop_probability_min:   0.524                     #Minimum value for the loop probability, to accept a loop
R_min:                  7.5                      #Minimum radius in which loops are searched -> added to this is the current uncertainty of the position (computed with odometry)
r_max:                  50.0                      #Maximum range for feature computation
n_verify:               3                         #Verify loop -> detect at least another loop between current id and [loop_id-n_verify,loop_id+n_verify]
                                                  #n_verify<1 -> disabled
n_max_nodes:            200                       #Maximum number of nodes used for loop search -> if more nodes are available, a random subset of size n_max_nodes is used
alpha_thres:            0.5                       #Multi session operation: alpha=nodes_WM_local_map/nodes_WM_all
                                                  #alpha<alpha_thres -> Localization in map from different session not yet done -> Search for loops throughout WM
n_ms_verify:            3                         #Verification for multi session operation: n_ms_verify consecutive loop candidates must lie within radius R_ms_verify
R_ms_verify:            5.0                       #Verification for multi session operation: n_ms_verify consecutive loop candidates must lie within radius R_ms_verify
n_ms_start:             3                         #Multi session operation: for the first added n_ms_start loop pairs search for loops throughout WM instead within R_search
beta:                   0.0                       #Radius in which loops are searched R_search=R_min+beta*R_odom (disabled for KITTI since uncertainty doesn't grow steadily)

#Scan registration parameters
#Use standalone environment /cmr_lidarloop/src/Registration_Test to test registration with desired scans
sky_direction:          -2                        #Axis pointing to the sky to identify z-axis in the current coordinate system

z_limit:                1.0                       #Z-coordinate at which the point clouds are trimmed (to avoid random points on the ground)

n_min_points:           7000                      #Both filtered clouds should have more points than n_min_points. Otherwise loop pair is rejected, because registration is too challenging
min_inliers:            1000                      #Minimum number of inliers to accept a transformation (after outlier rejection)
t_max:                  10.0                       #Maximum translational offset. Only if the translational offset calculated from the LiDAR registration is smaller,
                                                  #the loop is accepted and the link is sent to RTAB-Map
path_clouds:            '/home/stuede/clouds'  #Path where the point clouds of every registered loop pair are to be stored. If 'false' no clouds are saved
